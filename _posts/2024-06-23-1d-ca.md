## Elementary Cellular Automata

The elementary cellular automata is the classic prototype of many simulations we'll explore. Stephan Wolfram wrote a [nice book](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/) about the topic, which is a pretty approachable read, and a recommendation for anyone interested in CA. 

The beauty we notice when exploring CA systems is no coincidence! Inducing complexity from simple rules is something humans have been doing for [quite some time](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p43--why-these-discoveries-were-not-made-before/), and we're here to propagate these ideas through a [new medium](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html).

The rules will make more sense with pictures associated with them, like the ones in [Chapter 2](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/) of Wolfram's book. For that we will spare the details so we can get to running examples ourselves.

## Code

```
import numpy as np
import cv2

RESOLUTION = 1023


cells = np.zeros((RESOLUTION, RESOLUTION), dtype=np.uint8)

# Seed

dens = 0.5
cells[0, :] = np.random.choice([0, 1], RESOLUTION, p=[1 - dens, dens])

# cells[0, RESOLUTION // 2] = 1


# We'll assign the rule in [0, 255]
rule = 110


# Now let's calculate
for i in range(1, RESOLUTION):
    for j in range(RESOLUTION):
        left = cells[i-1, (j-1) % RESOLUTION]
        center = cells[i-1, j]
        right = cells[i-1, (j+1) % RESOLUTION]

        # bit magic
        value = (rule >> (4*left + 2*center + right)) & 1

        cells[i, j] = value


cells *= 255


# Color
# First make 3 channels for the image
cells = np.expand_dims(cells, axis=-1)
cells = np.repeat(cells, 3, axis=-1)
cells = cv2.cvtColor(cells, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HLS_FULL)


a = np.linspace(0, np.pi, RESOLUTION)


cells[:, :, 0] = 32 * np.sin(a) + 180
cells[:, :, 1] = 255 - 0.5 * cells[:, :, 1]
cells[:, :, 2] = 127


cells = cells.astype(np.uint8)

cells = cv2.cvtColor(cells, cv2.COLOR_HLS2BGR_FULL)

cv2.imshow('1D CA', cells)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

## Music

Coincidentally, a while back I recorded a small collection of music called [Algorithm Space](https://rickhowell.bandcamp.com/album/algorithm-space) available on all of the popular streaming platforms that uses Rule 110 for the cover.
