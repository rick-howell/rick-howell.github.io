## Attraction Algorithm

The algorithm we'll build up to here is an implementation of [particle life](https://particle-life.com/), and the idea is amazingly simple. That's not to take away from the beauty of it, but more-so to relate it back to our notions of cellular automata. 

Whether or not this system actually is a [CA](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/) or just a regular [automaton](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2004-05/automata-theory/basics.html) is not something I will try to parse hereâ€” but the spirit of particle life is in setting up a basic set of rules and watching the system *evolve*. 

I don't consider there to be any sort of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) happening here, since there are no 'generations' or mechanisms of propagating natural selection, but it's hard to look at the changing [emergent behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) and not at least feel some flavor of biology. 

## The Big Idea

We take a few [classes](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EquivalenceClass.html) of cells, and throw them into our world. Each class has fixed [attractive forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force) between other classes and including the interaction of one class acting on itself. 

With just these simple ideas you can begin to build very interesting simulations.


\
Below is an example script using an arbitrary* [attraction function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GaussianFunction.html). Press spacebar to change the matrix, and feel free to adjust parameters as you see fit!

*Most examples we encounter have an attraction function that is only arbitrary up to [unimodality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodality#Other_extensions). That function we choose just has to scale dependent on the force of attraction. For instance, in the following code we use a piecewise combination of [polynomials](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polynomial.html) to define the force, while the [PL creator](https://particle-life.com/about/tom-mohr.html) used strictly linear functions for his archetypal examples. 

One thing to consider if our goal is to see something more in line with emergence of 'life' and not so much a celestial body simulation, is a negative force when particles are close together. This gives the spongey biological nature we all know and love. 

It's important to note the use of [vectorized operations](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/VectorizedOperations.html) to keep computation time slow. 


### Extending The Rules

We may also consider using [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic) to make the particles wrap around the screen.

NumPy arrays are pretty fast, so scaling [into the third dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point) is well within our computational bounds.

Overall, there is a lot of experimentation and beauty that can come about, so we should be sure to explore.
