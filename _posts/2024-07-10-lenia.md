## Analog Cellular Automata

So far we've seen a few example of cellular automata, notably the [Elementary CA](https://rick-howell.github.io/1dca/), and the [Game of Life](https://rick-howell.github.io/gol/). 

When we extended the game of life, we already saw how useful [convolution](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Convolution.html) could help us in extending the rules, and now we'll take that idea and go even further.

## Lenia

[Lenia](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html) is an extension that uses [floats](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) for the cells in the world, instead of binary values. The [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03742) outlines exactly the process we'll use here for our code example.

We'll take a grid world $$A$$ with random values in [0, 1], a small circular kernel $$K \in \mathbb{R^2}$$, and a unimodal growth function $$G : [0, \infty] \rightarrow [-1, 1]$$.

The world $$A$$ is simulated according to the following condition:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{t+1} = [A_t + dt \ G(K * A_t)]_0^1
\end{aligned}
$$

```
import numpy as np
import cv2

WORLD_SIZE = 256


# Kernel Parameters
kernel_size = 40
alpha = 4.0

# Growth Function Parameters
mu = 0.15
sigma = 0.02

# Time step
dt = 0.1


# We'll first make a kernel
x = np.linspace(-1, 1, kernel_size)
y = np.linspace(-1, 1, kernel_size)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
R = np.clip(R, 0, 1)
K = 4 * R * (1 - R)
K = np.maximum(K, 1e-11)

kernel = np.exp(alpha * (1 - np.divide(1, K)))
kernel /= np.sum(kernel)


# Next we can make a growth function, but this time it should be in the range [-1, 1]
def gfxn(U):
    return np.exp(-((U - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))) * 2 - 1


# Now we'll make a random world
A = np.random.rand(WORLD_SIZE, WORLD_SIZE)


# And with that, we're ready to cook
while True:

    # Convolve
    U = cv2.filter2D(A, -1, kernel, borderType=cv2.BORDER_WRAP)

    # Apply growth function
    G = gfxn(U)

    # Update
    X = A + G * dt

    # Restrict the range
    A = np.clip(X, 0, 1) 

    # Display
    display = cv2.resize(A, (512, 512), interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)
    cv2.imshow('lenia', display)

    # Process inputs
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord('q') or cv2.getWindowProperty('lenia', cv2.WND_PROP_VISIBLE) < 1:
        break


cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Extending The Rules

Following the article, Bert provides examples of how to change the architecture to incorporate multiple channels and kernels. 

I have spent quite some time trying to incorporate a 3 channel Lenia system for [image segmentation](https://www.ibm.com/topics/image-segmentation). Here's an example with my [computer science professor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lzMFBvQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as a source image:

### One iteration:
![First Lenia Iteration](/img/l31.webp)

## 23 Iterations:
![23rd Lenia Iteration](/img/l323.webp)

More work to come with image segmentation, but as far as art is concerned, I find much more organic results by using multiple kernels of different sizes, with different growth functions.
