In my linear algebra class this semester we have been going through the classic [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/). This book is very illuminating, but I must admit, it could use more examples. That being said, there was a fun excercise I want to share. We just finished the section on [eigenvalues and eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors), and one of the problems in this chapter is to determine a [closed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression) solution to the Fibonacci Sequence in a way that I haven't seen before.

## Refresher

**1.** Let's define the __Fibonacci Sequence__, $$(F_n)$$ for $$n \in \{0, 1, \dots\}$$ by $$F_0 = 0$$, $$F_1 = 1$$, and for $$n \geq 2$$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_n = F_{n-2} + F_{n-1}
\end{equation*}
$$

\
**2.** A [linear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) from a vector space $$V$$ to another vector space $$W$$ is a function 

$$
\begin{equation*}
T:V \rightarrow W
\end{equation*}
$$

such that $$\forall u, v \in V$$ and $$\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{F}$$ (with $$\mathbb{F}$$ being the field that $$V$$ is defined on)

$$
\begin{align*}
T(u + v) &= Tu + Tv \\
T(\alpha v) &= \alpha Tv
\end{align*}
$$

\
We then define an **eigenvalue** $$\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$$ as the element satisfying $$Tv = \lambda v$$ for some $$v$$ that isn't the zero vector. 

Note that the existence of an eigenvalue is not guaranteed for us. For example, a linear map over $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ sending $$(1,0) \mapsto (0,1)$$ and $$(0,1) \mapsto (-1, 0)$$ only has eigenvalues over $$\mathbb{C}$$.

\
An **eigenvector** of $$\lambda$$ then is a non-zero vector $$v$$ satisfying $$Tv = \lambda v$$.

## Basis

If $$T : V \rightarrow V$$ has $$\text{dim} V$$ distinct eigenvalues, we can turn the corresponding eigenvectors into a basis for $$V$$. There are a few ways to motivate this through direct sums and such, but we'll save this for later.

Nifty, but if you have taken any class that throws matrices around, you know how often humans like to change the basis of their vector space. Why would this make things more interesting?

There's a fun consequence about repeated applications of the linear map. Consider $$T^2v = T(Tv)$$, If $$v$$ is an eigenvector, then $$Tv = \lambda v$$, and so $$T^2 v = T(Tv) = T(\lambda v) = \lambda Tv = \lambda ^2 v$$

So, finding what happens to a vector under repeated applications of a linear map can be done by representing the vector in a basis of eigenvectors, and then scaling the eigenvectors by the corresponding eigenvalues raised to some power. 

I.e. $$T^kv = \lambda^kv$$

## The Big Idea

### 1.

Let's define a linear map

$$
\begin{align*}
T:\mathbb{R}^2 &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2 \\
(x, y) &\mapsto (y, x + y)
\end{align*}
$$

Then for the vector $$(0, 1)$$, we claim that $$T^n(0, 1) = (F_n, F_{n+1})$$.

$$
\begin{align*}
T^0(0, 1) = (0, 1) \\
T^1(0, 1) = (1, 1) \\
T^2(0, 1) = T(T(0, 1)) = T(1, 1) = (1, 2) \\
T^3(0, 1) = \dots = (2, 3)
\end{align*}
$$

We can continue inductively to show that this works for all non negative integers:

$$
\begin{align*}
T^{n+1}(0, 1) \\
T(T^n)(0, 1) \\
T(F_n, F_{n+1}) \\
(F_{n+1}, F_{n} + F_{n+1}) \\
(F_{n+1}, F_{n+2})
\end{align*}
$$

Hooray! We have a linear map in which repeatedly applying it gives us the next Fibonacci number. 

### 2.

Let's see if we can find eigenvalues over $$\mathbb{R}$$.

We need to see if $$T(x, y) = \lambda (x, y)$$ for some nonzero vector. 

$$
\begin{align*}
T(x, y) &= \lambda (x, y) \\
(y, x+y) &= (\lambda x, \lambda y) \\
y = \lambda x & \text{ and } x + y = \lambda y \\
x + \lambda x & = \lambda^2x \\
\lambda^2 - \lambda - 1 &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

From this we get two values, $$\lambda_1 = \frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$$, and $$\lambda_2 = \frac{1-\sqrt5}{2}$$. Is this starting to look familiar?

P.S. since the dimension of our vector space is 2, and the eigenvalues are distinct, we know we've found em all.

### 3.

Out of dumb luck I stumbled into a few eigenvectors, namely $$v_1 = (-\lambda_2, 1), v_2 = (-\lambda_1, 1)$$. We can see

$$
\begin{align*}
Tv_1 = (1, 1-\lambda_2) \\ 
(-\lambda_1 \lambda_2, \lambda_1) \\
\lambda_1(-\lambda_2, 1) \\
\lambda_1 v_1
\end{align*}
$$

and a similar calculation shows that $$Tv_2 = \lambda_2 v_2$$ 

### 4.

Finally, we are ready to compute $$T^n(0, 1)$$.

We'll represent $$(0, 1)$$ in the eigenvector basis:

$$
\begin{equation*}
(0, 1) = \frac{1}{\lambda_1-\lambda_2}(\lambda_1v_1 - \lambda_2v_2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt5}(\lambda_1v_1 - \lambda_2v_2)
\end{equation*}
$$

Then, from what we looked at before, (and note that $$\lambda_1\lambda_2 = -1$$),

$$
\begin{align*}
T^n&(0, 1) \\
T^n \frac{1}{\sqrt5} &\biggl[ \lambda_1v_1 - \lambda_2v_2 \biggr] \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt5} &\biggl[ \lambda_1 T^n v_1 - \lambda_2 T^n v_2 \biggr] \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt5} &\biggl[ \lambda_1^{n+1} v_1 - \lambda_2^{n+1} v_2 \biggr] \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt5} &\biggl( \lambda_1^n - \lambda_2^n, \lambda_1^{n+1} - \lambda_2^{n+1} \biggr)
\end{align*}
$$

Now if we remember from part 1, the first component of $$T^n(0, 1)$$ is the actual value of $$F_n$$, and so we conclude:

$$
\begin{equation*}
F_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt5}\biggl[ \biggl( \frac{1 + \sqrt5}{2} \biggr)^n - \biggl( \frac{1 - \sqrt5}{2} \biggr)^n \biggr]
\end{equation*}
$$

## Final Remarks

Axler decided to throw in a real monkey wrench in the next part, so I won't cover it here. It's literally about showing that the $$\biggl( \frac{1 - \sqrt5}{2} \biggr)^n$$ term doesn't really contribute much. After doing all of this algebra it felt out of the blue to have an analysis problem... (Check 5D Excercise 21 part e in the 4th edition).

It's always funny to see closed forms that *are* integers but look like they absolutely shouldn't be. Finding this solution through raw linear algebra was also a first for me, and I found it so entertaining I had to share it. 

We can plot the vector field too (if you remember the vector field visualizer I was playing around with earlier)

This lets us clearly see the eigenvectors, but in looking at a field like this you would never know that the Fibonacci Sequence was lurking underneath.
